# CP4-Notes
Theodore Arakatickytakis
Start an HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html>  .
Then put all HTML code between the tags <html>   and </html>
/tag is a closing tag and without the / its an opening tag.
Put information on what your website is between the tags <head>    and     </head>    . This saves to metadata.
To make a page title use <title>     . Title appears in browser bar.
Put content that you actually want to display in your webpage in between the <body>     </body>       .
In order to write a paragraph use <p>     .
Use <br/>  to skip a line.    You do not need a closing tag for this.
