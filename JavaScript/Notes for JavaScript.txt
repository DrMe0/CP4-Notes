Consol is used to keepm travk of output.
Use console.log("Hello!"); to print something or log it.
Data type: Strings are in double quotes and are any random numbers and letters. Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number.
          Booleans — Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean.
          Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.
Math: JavaScript supports the following math operators:
      Add: +
      Subtract: -
      Multiply: *
      Divide: /
Use .lenght to find the number of characters in a instance, which is anything you submit. Example: console.log("Teaching the world how to code".length);
Method makes stuff happen. You can use them inside a brcket with a (0 at the end of them to make them do stuff. On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey". This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses. Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.
Use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype to look at stuff.
To remove whitespace put the .trim method.
Library, use to call a method without an instance. Just put it in console.log.
Math.random() * 50; It will retiurn a number between 0 and 1. Use the * and 50.
Math.floor rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.
Example of putting things in brackets:
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))
Comment put after // or for a multy line comment put it between /* and */
Variables: 
const, short for constant, is a JavaScript keyword that creates a new variable with a value that cannot change.
myName is the variable's name. Notice that the word has no spaces, and we capitalized the N. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camelCasing, because the capital letters look like the humps on a camel's back.
= is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName).
'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName. Example:
const myName = 'Arya';
After the variable is declared, we can print 'Arya' to the console with: console.log(myName).
Use let to create a more changable vafriable.
Math
The first three operators (+=, -=, and *=) perform the mathematical operation of the first operator (+, -, or *) using the number on the right, then assign the new value to the variable.
The last two operators are the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. These operators are responsible for increasing and decreasing a number variable by one, respectively.

The JavaScript term for inserting the data saved to a variable into a string is string interpolation.

The + operator, known until now as the addition operator, is used to interpolate (insert) a string variable into a string, as follows:

let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
You can accomplis the same thing by using ${}. Example: console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`) Make sure to put those cool things instead of quotations marks.


Review

Variables hold reusable data in a program.
JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.
You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.
Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.
In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.

Control Flow

Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition. If a given condition is true, we execute one block of code. If the statement is false, we execute another block of code.

if/else statements

Lines of code between curly braces are called blocks. if/else statements have two code blocks. If the variable needsCoffee is true, the program will run the first block of code. Otherwise, it will run the other block of code.
needsCoffee is the condition we are checking inside the if's parentheses. Since it is equal to true, our program will run the code between the first opening curly brace { (line 2) and the first closing curly brace } (line 4). It will ignore the else { ... } part. In this case, we'd see Finding coffee log to the console.
If needsCoffee were false, only the console.log() statement in the else block would be executed.
Examples:
let needsCoffee = true;
if (needsCoffee === true) {
    console.log('Finding coffee');
} else {
    console.log('Keep on keeping on!');
}
The second line of this program checks a condition if (variableOne). In the previous exercise, we checked if a variable was equal to true or false. By only writing the name of the variable as the condition, we are checking the truthiness of the variableOne. In this case, variableOne contains a truthy value.

If we changed if (variableOne) to say if (variableTwo), that condition would evaluate to falsy because we have not created a variable called variableTwo in this program. In other words, variableOne is truthy and variableTwo is falsy.

All variables that have been created and set are truthy (and will evaluate to true if they are the condition of a control flow statement) unless they contain one of the seven values listed below:

false
0 and -0
"" and '' (empty strings)
null
undefined
NaN (Not a Number)
document.all (something you will rarely encounter)

JavaScript provides an operator for swapping the truthiness and falsiness of values - the exclamation point (!). We can use this in conditional statements as shorthand to check if the value of a variable evaluates to false rather than true.

let isPhoneCharged = true; 
if (!isPhoneCharged) {
  console.log('Plug in your phone!');
} else {
  console.log('No need to charge!');
}
There are two comparisons you might be familiar with:

Less than: <
Greater than: >
You may also recognize these:

Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=
These comparisons evaluate to true or false.

There are two more useful comparisons we can make. Often, we might want to check if two things are equal to each other or if they are not.

To check if two things equal each other, we write === (three = signs in a row).
To check if two things do not equal each other, we write !== (an exclamation with two = signs in a row).
It can be confusing when to use one = sign and when to use three === signs. Use a single = to assign a value to a variable. Use ===to compare the values of two different variables.

We've explored if/else statements that answer questions that are either yes or no. What can we do if we have a question that has multiple yes conditions, or multiple no conditions?

We can add more conditions to our if/else statement with else if. Check out how this fits into our current knowledge of if/else statements:

let stopLight = 'green';

if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}
1. We created a variable named stopLight that is assigned to the string green.

2. Then, there's an if/else statement with multiple conditions, using else if. else if allows us to check multiple values of the stopLight variable and output different things based on its color.

3. The block ends with the singular else we have seen before. The else is a catch-all for any other situation. For instance, if the stopLight was blinking blue, the last else would catch it and return a default message.

We can translate certain thoughts into JavaScript code such as, "Are these things equal?" with ===, or, "Is one thing greater than another thing?" with >.

In English, sometimes we say "both of these things" or "either one of these things." Let's translate those phrases into JavaScript with special operators called logical operators.

To say "both must be true," we use &&.
To say "either can be true," we use ||.
For example:

if (stopLight === 'green' && pedestrians === false) {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Stop');
}
In the example above, we make sure that the stopLight is 'green' and (&&) there are no pedestrians before we log Go!.
If either of those conditions is false, we log Stop.
Just like the operators we learned previously, these logical operators will return either true or false.

These logical operators are helpful when writing if/else statements since they let us make sure multiple variables are true or false. We can combine these operators with all of the ones we have learned throughout this lesson.

Before we move on, let's circle back to else if statements.

Using else if is a great tool for when we have a few different conditions we'd like to consider.

else if is limited, however. If we want to write a program with 25 different conditions, like a JavaScript cash register, we'd have to write a lot of code, and it can be difficult to read and understand.

To deal with times when you need many else if conditions, we can turn to a switch statement to write more concise and readable code.

To a computer, a switch statement and an if/else statement are the same, but a switch statement can be easier for other humans to read. Part of being a good developer is writing code that both computers and other humans can read.

switch statements look like this:

let groceryItem = 'papaya';

switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}
The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the condition that each case will compare to. In the example, the condition is groceryItem.
Inside the block, { ... }, there are cases. case is like the else if part of an if/else if/else statement. The word following the first case is 'tomato'. If groceryItem equalled 'tomato', that case's console.log() would run.
groceryItem equals 'papaya', so the first and second case statements are skipped. The third case runs since the case is 'papaya', which matches groceryItem's value. This particular program will log Papayas are $1.29.
Then the program stops with the break keyword. This keyword will prevent the switch statement from executing any more of its code. Without adding break at the end of each case, the program will execute the code for all matching cases and the default code as well. This behavior is different from if/else conditional statements which execute only one block of code.
At the end of each switch statement, there is a default condition. If none of the cases are true, then this code will run.

In the previous exercise, we learned shorthand for writing multiple if/else if/else statements to make them easier to read. JavaScript also provides a way to shorten simple if/else statements called the ternary operator.

let isNightTime = true;

if (isNightTime) {
  console.log('Turn on the lights!');
} else {
  console.log('Turn off the lights!');
}
In the example above, we see a very familiar pattern. See the example below for an equivalent way to express this.

isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
The code in the example above will operate exactly as the code from the previous example. Let's break this example into its parts:

isNightTime ? — the conditional statement followed by a question mark. This checks if isNightTime is truthy.
console.log ('Turn on the lights!') — this code will be executed if the condition is truthy.
: — a colon separates the two different blocks of code that can be executed.
console.log('Turn off the lights!'); — this code will be executed if the condition is falsy
In this example, we checked if the value of a variable was true or false. The ternary operator can be used for any condition that can be evaluated to true or false, such as those with comparison operators.

age >= 16 ? console.log('You are old enough to drive in the United States!') : console.log('You are not old enough to drive in the United States!');
In the example above, the conditional statement is checking whether the value of the variable age is greater than or equal to 16. If so, a message that states the user is old enough to drive will be logged to the console. Otherwise, a message that states the user is not old enough to drive will be logged.

Way to go! We just learned a lot of control flow concepts:

if/else statements make binary decisions and execute different code based on conditions.
All conditions are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.
We can add more conditional statements to if/else statements with else if.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read and achieve the same result.
The ternary operator (?) and a colon (:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables or values.
After two values are compared, the conditional statement evaluates to true or false.
The logical operator && checks if both sides of a condition are truthy.
The logical operator || checks if either side is truthy.
The logical operator !== checks if the two sides are not equal.
An exclamation mark (!) switches the truthiness / falsiness of the value of a variable.
One equals symbol (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
Three equals symbols (===) are used to check if two variables are equal to each other.

How does this code work?

let calculatorIsOn = false;

const pressPowerButton = () => {
  if (calculatorIsOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorIsOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorIsOn = true;
  }
};

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.
Let's explore each part in detail.

1. We created a function named pressPowerButton.

const pressPowerButton creates a variable with a given name written in camelCase.
The variable is then set equal = to a set of parentheses followed by an arrow token () =>, indicating the variable stores a function. This syntax is known as arrow function syntax.
Finally, between the curly braces {} is the function body, or the JavaScript statements that define the function. This is followed by a semi-colon ;. In JavaScript, any code between curly braces is also known as a block.
2. Inside the function body is an if/else statement. 

3. On the last few lines, we call the function by writing its name followed by a semi-colon pressPowerButton();. This executes the function, running all code within the function body. 

4. We executed the code in the function body twice without having to write the same set of instructions twice. Functions can make code reusable!


So far our function has not required any input. We can also write functions that accept data. We do this with parameters. Parameters are variables in a function definition that represent data we can input into the function.

const multiplyByThirteen = (inputNumber) => {
  console.log(inputNumber * 13);
};

multiplyByThirteen(9);
// Output: 117
Let's explore how this function works:

We add inputNumber within the parentheses () => of the multiplyByThirteen function. inputNumber is a parameter.
Inside the multiplyByThirteen() function, we use console.log to print the inputNumber multiplied by 13.
When we call the multiplyByThirteen() function on the last line, we set the inputNumber parameter. Here, we set it to 9. Then, inside the function block, 9 is multiplied by 13, resulting in 117 printing to the console.
Note on terminology: inputNumber is a parameter, but when we call multiplyByThirteen(9), the 9 is called an argument. In other words, arguments are provided when you call a function, and parameters receive arguments as their value. When we set the value 9 as the argument, we pass a value to the function.
Parameters let us write logic inside functions that are modified when we call the function. This makes functions more flexible.

If we can set one parameter, can we set two?

We can set as many parameters as we'd like by adding them when we declare the function, separated by commas, like this:

const getAverage = (numberOne, numberTwo) => {
  const average = (numberOne + numberTwo) / 2 ;
  console.log(average);
};

getAverage(365, 27);
// Output: 196
The getAverage() function has two parameters: numberOne and numberTwo, both entered in the parentheses ().
When we call the getAverage() function on the last line, we include two numbers as the parameters, also separated by commas.

In this case, we are telling the function to assign numberOne the value of 365 and numberTwo the value of 27. We are passing in 365 and 27 to the getAverage() function.

When getAverage() runs, the function knows what numberOne and numberTwo equal since we passed in two parameters when we called the function. Therefore it evaluates (365 + 27) / 2 and stores the result in the average variable. When logged to the console, the value of the average is 196.

By adding multiple parameters, we can build functions that are more flexible. Now the function has two variables that we can define when we call the function.

Using console.log() as the result of a function isn't the best use of a function. The purpose of a function is to take some input, perform some task on that input, then return a result.

To return a result, we can use the return keyword. Take a look at our function from the last exercise, now re-written slightly:

const getAverage = (numberOne, numberTwo) => {
  const average = (numberOne + numberTwo) / 2;
  return average;
}

console.log(getAverage(365, 27));
// Output: 196
1. Instead of using console.log() inside the getAverage() function, we used the return keyword. return will take the value of the variable and return it. 

2. On the last line, we called the getAverage() function inside of a console.log() statement, which outputted the result of 196. 

3. This code achieved the same output as before, however now our code is better. Why? If we wanted to use the getAverage() function in another place in our program, we could without printing the result to the console. Using return is generally a best practice when writing functions, as it makes your code more maintainable and flexible.

In the last exercise, we pointed out that using return makes programs more maintainable and flexible, but how exactly?

When functions return their value, we can use them together and inside one another. If our calculator needed to have a Celsius to Fahrenheit operation, we could write it with two functions like so:

const multiplyByNineFifths = (celsius) => {
  return celsius * (9/5);
};

const getFahrenheit = (celsius) => {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
};

console.log('The temperature is ' + getFahrenheit(15) + '°F');
// Output: The temperature is 59°F
Take a look at the getFahrenheit() function. Inside of its block, we called multiplyByNineFifths() and passed it the degrees in celsius. The multiplyByNineFifths() function multiplied the celsius by (9/5). Then it returned its value so the getFahrenheit() function could continue on to add 32 to it.

Finally, on the last line, we interpolated the function call within a console.log() statement. This works because getFahrenheit() returns its value.

We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then use them when we need to. Writing functions can help take large and difficult problems and break them into small and manageable problems.
