HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
Start an HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html>  .
Then put all HTML code between the tags <html>   and </html>
/tag is a closing tag and without the / its an opening tag.
Put information on what your website is between the tags <head>    and     </head>    . This saves to metadata.
To make a page title use <title>     . Title appears in browser bar.
Put content that you actually want to display in your webpage in between the <body>     </body>       .
In order to write a paragraph use <p>     .
Use <br/>  to skip a line.  Or <br>  You do not need a closing tag for this.
Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <div>

    </div>
  
  </body>
</html>


The browser always ignores space and lines between tags, put some to make your code easier to read.
Commenting is possible by putting your code between <!--     -->     .
An element inside another element is called a child element.
Heading are made by using the h(number of heading). Their are six different types of heading 1 (most imnportant) 6 (less important). Example h1.
<div>    is used to contain html elements and devide them into sections.
<span>    contain small peice3s of text. Primarily used to wrap small pieces of text.
<em> Makes the writting italic    .
<strong> Makes the writting bold   .
Lists can be made with the <ul>  tag. This makes a bullet point list. Items are then added with <li>  tag.  Example:  
  <ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>
  
Numbered lists can be made with the <ol>   tag.
  
  
To add images use the <img>  tag.
  Example:   <img src="image-location.com" />
src   attribute is assigned to the images source.
Is a self closing tag.
 Attributes provide information about content.
<alt>   attribute is used to provide alternate information if image cannot be seen.k,            
Videos use the <video>   tag and have all the same properties as the <img>   tag. But it is not an self closing tag. If you put text in between the two tags that is not in the tag it will only be dsiaplyed if the video is unavailable.
<width>   and   <height>   used to set the width and widht of something.
<controls> used to set if the broswers plays the video or not.

 <a>  tag is for links.
 Example: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
 Location attribute is href   . Put data that you want the link to say in between the two tags.
 If you put target="_blank"  it opens in a new tab.
 <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>  Directs link to file in the dsame folder that is not some random rthing on thew web it is an internal link.
Put    id   in a tag to give it an id. Example: <p id="top"> This is the top of the page! </p>     .
#top  : thats how you put an id  . Example:   <a href="#top">Top</a>
Create a navigation bar      <nav>     .
In order to create a table make use     <table>    .
Table rows can be made with    <tr>  .
Table info added with    <td>   .
