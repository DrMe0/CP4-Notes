		<p>Then put all HTML code between the tags <strong> <html> </strong> and <strong> </html> </strong> </p>
		<p> HTML is run with tags. A tag with a backslash is a closing tag. A tag without a backslash is a opening tag. </p>
		<h4> Head </h4>
		<p> Information that dioes not appear on your website buit still is about it goes between the <strong>(head)</strong> and <strong>(/head)</strong>. Metadata! </p>
		<p>To make a page title use (title). Title appears in browser bar. </p>
		<h4> Body </h4>
		<p>Put content that you actually want to display in your webpage in between the <strong> (body) </strong>and<strong>(/body)</strong>   .
		<p>In order to write a paragraph use the <strong>(p)</strong> tag. </p>
		<p>Use <strong>(br/)</strong> or <strong>(br)</strong>. You do not need a closing tag for this. </p>
		<p>Heading are made by using the h(number of heading). Their are six different types of heading 1 (most important) 6 (less important). Example h1. </p>
<div>    is used to contain html elements and devide them into sections.
<span>    contain small peices of text. Primarily used to wrap small pieces of text.
<em> Makes the writting italic    .
<strong> Makes the writting bold   .
Lists can be made with the <ul>  tag. This makes a bullet point list. Items are then added with <li>  tag.  Example:  
  <ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>

Videos use the <video>   tag and have all the same properties as the <img>   tag. But it is not an self closing tag. If you put text in between the two tags that is not in the tag it will only be dsiaplyed if the video is unavailable.
<width>   and   <height>   used to set the width and widht of something.
<controls> used to set if the broswers plays the video or not.

 <a>  tag is for links.

 <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>  Directs link to file in the dsame folder that is not some random rthing on thew web it is an internal link.
Put    id   in a tag to give it an id. Example: <p id="top"> This is the top of the page! </p>     .
#top  : thats how you put an id  . Example:   <a href="#top">Top</a>
Create a navigation bar      <nav>     .
In order to create a table make use     <table>    .
Table rows can be made with    <tr>  .
