HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
Start an HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html>  .
Then put all HTML code between the tags <html>   and </html>
/tag is a closing tag and without the / its an opening tag.
Put information on what your website is between the tags <head>    and     </head>    . This saves to metadata.
To make a page title use <title>     . Title appears in browser bar.
Put content that you actually want to display in your webpage in between the <body>     </body>       .
In order to write a paragraph use <p>     .
Use <br/>  to skip a line.    You do not need a closing tag for this.
Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <div>

    </div>
  
  </body>
</html>


The browser always ignores space and lines between tags, put some to make your code easier to read.
Commenting is possible by putting your code between <!--     -->     .
An element inside another element is called a child element.
Heading are made by using the h(number of heading). Their are six different types of heading 1 (most imnportant) 6 (less important). Example h1.
