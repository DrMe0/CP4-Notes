		<h3> In this document, < and > will be replaced with ( and ). </h3>
		<p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. </p>
		<h4> Basics </h3>
		<p>Start an HTML document with <strong> (!DOCTYPE html) </strong> </p>
		<p>Then put all HTML code between the tags <strong> <html> </strong> and <strong> </html> </strong> </p>
		<p> HTML is run with tags. A tag with a backslash is a closing tag. A tag without a backslash is a opening tag. </p>
		<h4> Head </h4>
		<p> Information that dioes not appear on your website buit still is about it goes between the <strong>(head)</strong> and <strong>(/head)</strong>. Metadata! </p>
		<p>To make a page title use (title). Title appears in browser bar. </p>
		<h4> Body </h4>
		<p>Put content that you actually want to display in your webpage in between the <strong> (body) </strong>and<strong>(/body)</strong>   .
		<p>In order to write a paragraph use the <strong>(p)</strong> tag. </p>
		<p>Use <strong>(br/)</strong> or <strong>(br)</strong>. You do not need a closing tag for this. </p>
		<p>Heading are made by using the h(number of heading). Their are six different types of heading 1 (most important) 6 (less important). Example h1. </p>
		<p>(div) is used to contain html elements and devide them into sections. </p>
		<p>(span) contain small peices of text. Primarily used to wrap small pieces of text.</p>
		<p>(em) Makes the writting italic. (strong) Makes the writting bold. </p>
		<h4>Lists</h4>
		<p>Lists can be made with the (ul)  tag. This makes a bullet point list. Items are then added with (li)  tag.  Example:</p>
		<p>(ul)<br>(li)Limes(/li)<br>(li)Happiness(/li)<br>(/ul)<br> This gives:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Limes </li>
			<li>Happiness</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Numbered lists can be made with the (ol) tag. </p>
		<h4> External Items </h4>
		<h5>Images </h5>
		<p>To add images use the (img) tag. Example: (img src="image-location.com" /). Is a self closing tag. </p>
		<p>src is assigned to the image source. The alt attribute is used to provide alternate information if image cannot be seen. </p>           
		<h5>Video </h5>
		<p>Videos use the (video) tag and have all the same properties as the (img) tag. But it is not an self closing tag. If you put text in between the two tags that is not in the tag it will only be displayed if the video is unavailable. </p>
		<p>(width) and (height) used to set the width and height of something. </p>
		<p>(controls) used to set if the broswers plays the video or not. </p>
		<h5>Links </h5>
		<p>The (a) tag is for links. </p>
		<p>Example: (a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/")This Is A Link To Wikipedia(/a). This gives: </p>
		<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
		Location attribute is href   . Put data that you want the link to say in between the two tags.
 If you put target="_blank"  it opens in a new tab.
 <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>  Directs link to file in the dsame folder that is not some random rthing on thew web it is an internal link.
Put    id   in a tag to give it an id. Example: <p id="top"> This is the top of the page! </p>     .
#top  : thats how you put an id  . Example:   <a href="#top">Top</a>
Create a navigation bar      <nav>     .
In order to create a table make use     <table>    .
Table rows can be made with    <tr>  .
Table info added with    <td>   .
<th>   then   scope  id is used to make a header.  Add id   row   to say this heading is for a row while adding   col    makes sure the computer nows that the heading is for a column.
Data can span columns using the   colspan   atribute.  Use  rowspan   to do the same thing with rows.
Example:  <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td>
Tables can be sectioned off using   <tbody> .  
To section off a tables heading use      <thead>    .
Bottom can be blocked off using    <tfoot> . </p>
<h4> Important: </h4>
<p> The browser always ignores space and lines between tags, put some to make your code easier to read. </p>
<h4>Structure: </h4>
		<p>(!DOCTYPE html)<br>(html)<br>(head)<br>(title)Hello World(/title)<br>(/head)<br>(body)<br>(h1)Hello World(/h1)<br>(/body)<br>(/html)</p>
